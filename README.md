# Project-Horiseon
Module 1 challenge 

1) The module 1 challenge was very difficult. It test many aspects of html and css. Both were equally challenging, however I feel as though css was by for the major hurdle of this challenge.
2) For some reason the deployed URL doesn't show any of the images and I'm not sure how to resolve it. 
3) I feel as though not much has been covered on CSS, thus the difficuly of the project has increased dramtically. 
4) Not much has been taught on how to deploy the website once the code has been finished, and it's also difficult to know if the website will be similar to what it looks like before the website upload. 
5)  On the deployed website https://b3nl99.github.io/Project-Horiseon/index.html , I see that the image are not appearing, even though it was fine when I was editing it on VS code. 
6) How I would descibe the project is that the project looks as the the HTML may have been the easiest, but the true purpose of the project may have been testing CSS. There are many nuances to the CSS code that it feels very overwhelming when there is a slight error in judgement.
